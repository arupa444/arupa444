# 👋 Hey, I’m Arupa Nanda Swain (@arupa444)

🚀 **AI Developer | Software Engineer | Research Enthusiast**  

I specialize in **Artificial Intelligence** and love building projects that connect AI with the real world — from **computer vision** to **chatbots**, **blockchain**, and **robotics**.  
Curiosity drives me to explore everything: whether it’s training deep learning models, writing efficient C code for research, or building smart contracts.
